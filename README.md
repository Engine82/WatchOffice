# Watch Office

Watch office is a tool to automate hiring for overtime at the Laconia, NH fire department. Overtime is assigned oon the first day of a firefighter's "tour," on a rotating basis by seniority. Historically this has been done manually by the on-duty officer, and Watch Office's purpose is to automate this process, saving time and making shift officers available to accomplish more meaningful tasks.
