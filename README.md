# Watch Office

Watch office is a tool to automate hiring for overtime at the Laconia, NH fire department. Overtime is assigned on the first day of a shift's "tour," on a rotating basis by seniority. Historically this has been done manually by the on-duty officer, and Watch Office's purpose is to automate this process, saving time and making shift officers available to accomplish more meaningful tasks.


## Schedule & Hiring Rules
Laconia firefighters work 24 hour shifts on a 8 day rotation. Firefighters work one 24 hour shift, have 48 hours off, work another 24 hour shift, and then have 96 hours off. It may also be charactarized as 1-2-1-4: 1 day on duty, 2 off, 1 on, and 4 off. The 1-2-1 portion is referred to as a platoon's "tour." On the first day of a tour, overtime is assigned for the next two days. Overtime is assigned by seniority, with the first shift assigned to the last person to not be hired. For example, if the senior-most firefighter was hired last during the current tour, the second-most senior firefighter would be hired first on the next tour. All overtime is mandatory; if a member does not wish to work his assigned overtime shift he may give it away to any other qualified member.

Newly hired firefighter are not elligible for overtime for their first four months so that they may have adequate time to learn the local area, how the department operates at emergencies, as well as have consistancy in partners as they learn.



## History

The name Watch Office comes from the room in many firehouses referred to as the "watch office" or "watch desk." Before electronic alerting systems, one firefighter would be assigned to "house watch" 24 hours a day, where they would listen to the dispatch radio and alert crews when they were dispatched to an emergency.
