# Watch Office

Watch office is a tool to automate hiring for overtime at the Laconia, NH fire department. Overtime is assigned on the first day of a shift's "tour," on a rotating basis by seniority. Historically this has been done manually by the on-duty officer, and Watch Office's purpose is to automate this process, saving time and making shift officers available to accomplish more meaningful tasks.


The name Watch Office comes from the room in many firehouses referred to as the "watch office" or "watch desk." Before electronic alerting systems, one firefighter would be assigned to "house watch" 24 hours a day, where they would listen to the dispatch radio and alert crews when they were dispatched to an emergency.
